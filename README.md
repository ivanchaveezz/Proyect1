OBJECTIVE 

Our main goal is to explore regional differences and variable correlation

-Explore cultural differences by region, taking popularity and ranking as the standard for our analysis and find interesting correlations between metrics.

INQUIRIES:

  -Correlation with popularity
  Is there a variable that influences popularity heavily?
  
  -Explicitness and popularity
  Which are the regions that listen more heavily themed music.
  
  -Danceability and region 
  Which are the regions that prefer highly danceable songs.
  
  - Top 1 analysis
  Are there common attributes amongst the top 1 song in each country?

  - Top artist by region
  Based on popularity (not rank) which is the most popular artist

We decided to concentrate only on one day because we wanted to see the relationship between the songs depending on their attributes and not their movement in the top. This allowed us to create the hypothesis that if there is an attribute that influences a song to be in the top or not.
