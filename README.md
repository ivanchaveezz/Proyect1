#OBJECTIVE 

Our main goal is to explore regional differences and variable correlation.Explore cultural differences by region, taking popularity and ranking as the standard for our analysis and find interesting correlations between metrics.

#INQUIRIES:

  - Correlation with popularity:
  Is there a variable that influences popularity heavily?
  
  - Explicitness and popularity:
  Which are the regions that listen more heavily themed music.
  
  - Danceability and region:
  Which are the regions that prefer highly danceable songs.
  
  - Top 1 analysis:
  Are there common attributes amongst the top 1 song in each country?

  - Top artist by region:
  Based on popularity (not rank) which is the most popular artist

We decided to concentrate only on one day because we wanted to see the relationship between the songs depending on their attributes and not their movement in the top. This allowed us to create the "hypothesis" that if there is an attribute that influences a song to be in the top or not.


Countries selection by region:

Asia: Republic of Korea, Taiwan, Singapore

North America: USA, Canada

Europe: France, United Kindom, Romania

Latin America: Mexico, Colombia, Chile


# Conclusions:

## Is there a variable that influences popularity heavily? ##
  
We have not see any KPI that has a strong relation vs popularity, how ever doing this excercise we can see that between KPIs we have some moderate and strong relations. For this part we use the pearson coefficient.

-Energy vs Loudness.

-Danceability vs Valance

-Energy vs Valance

-Loudness vs  Danceability
